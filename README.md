# Tiny Tapeout Analog Project - ADC Components

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

I aim to build as much of an ADC as I can as a complete analog novice with access to textbooks. We'll see where that gets me.

NOTE: Though I am currently a Google employee, this is not an officially supported Google product. This project is not eligible for the [Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program](https://bughunters.google.com/open-source-security).

## Analog project

As a Tiny Tapeout analog project, I followed the [analog specs page](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/analog/).
